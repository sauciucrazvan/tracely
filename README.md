Tracely is built using modern and efficient technologies, ensuring a smooth user experience and robust performance. The primary technologies and dependencies used in this project are:

- **Dart:** The programming language that powers Tracely's logic and functionality. 🎯
- **Flutter:** The UI toolkit for crafting natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. 📱💻🌐
- **Firebase:** A powerful platform that provides authentication and a real-time database, enabling seamless user authentication and data synchronization. 🔥

### Dependencies:
